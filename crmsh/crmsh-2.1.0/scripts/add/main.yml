- name: Add a new node to an already existing cluster
  description: >
    Installs missing packages and copies corosync.conf
    from one of the existing cluster nodes.

    This script is somewhat special: The nodes parameter
    must contain at least one node already in the cluster 
    as well as the new node to add.

    A more user-friendly interface to this script is 
    provided via the cluster add command.
  parameters:
    - name: node
      description: Node to add to the cluster
  steps:
    - name: Check cluster
      collect: add.py collect

    - name: Validate parameters
      validate: add.py validate

    - name: Install required packages
      apply: add.py install

    - name: Copy configuration files
      apply_local: add.py copy

    - name: Configure firewall
      apply: add.py firewall

    - name: Start cluster on new node
      apply: add.py start
