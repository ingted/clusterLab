TODO
====

== See Also ==

* Grep source for TODO.  Items are categorized must/should/could to indicate
  priority.


== Missing Features ==

* cibsecret support
* new style constraints (rsc_*)?


== Core/General == 

=== Must ===

* Native libpengine/libcib bindings should fix odd edge cases in status
  reporting:
** Failed stop with STONITH disabled, resulting in "Started $node (unmanaged)
   FAILED" in crm_mon, is erroneously reported as stopped resource in Hawk
   (although the failed stop error is shown).
** "crm node fence ..." -- hawk shows node being fenced as online, whereas
   crm_mon shows it as unclean.

=== Should & Could (in no particular order) ===
  
* Verify <%=raw vs. <%=h etc. for Rails3
* Replace popen3, safe_x, invoker etc. as much as possible with
  David Majda's command.rb
* Use PerRequestCache in more places if/when possible (e.g.: CrmConfig::load_meta,
  but that whole crm_config thing really needs a rewrite inline with how the
  other CibObject children work).
* All instances of jQuery.get() need to be replaced with .ajax() so we can
  handle errors properly (e.g.: 500 when disk is full running hb_report etc.)
* rescue_from with redirect in ApplicationController is probably a bit fragile
  when (possibly) called from, say, NodesController inside dialog.
* Ensure Hawk's gettext usage works with translation-update package
* Modal dialogs should probably be made moveable (and *maybe* resizable), some
  of these are already done.
* Syntax highlighting for ascii text (crm config, logs in explorer, etc.)
* Online help tied to SLE HA manual (on SLES, at least).
* Need to verify/match op interval when ignoring ops
* Translate simple errors from crm (bnc#713917)
** Already did permission denied, but need to check what other simple failures
   we can translate.
* Possibility of stale pidfiles with crm_history, hb_report, history_report
  (need to confirm process and pidfile existence)
* Use begin/ensure/end around file ops, see e.g. unlink at:
  http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/tempfile/rdoc/index.html
* Use X-Sendfile for delivering cibs, bz2s etc. in explorer & simulator
  (see http://www.therailsway.com/2009/2/22/file-downloads-done-right)
* Consolidate templates etc. for primitive, etc. as much as possible (not
  DRY enough).
* Root might not be able to be root via hawk_invoke (may need to remap
  requests for root to hacluster)
* NodesController, HbReportController - login_required may result in login
  page embedded in dialog
* primitive meta :required => e.attributes['required'].to_i == 1 : needs real
  bool conversion thing (1/0/true/false ala ocf_is_true)
* Does not support < 1.0 schema (do we care?  God I hope not).
* Verify rpm post upgrade restarts hawk if necessary (but not if someone's
  configured it to run as an LSB resource inside the cluster - not intended
  to run that way, but...)
* Doesn't work with SELinux enforcing (does work with permissive)
* Move logfiles to /var/log/hawk
** See also http://www.slideshare.net/lennartkoopmann/managing-the-logs-of-your-rails-applications-arrrrcamp-2011
* Nasty permission denied error if bob enables ACLs
* Warn if config changed out from under you while saving?  (In all cases,
  editing resources, crm_config, ...)
* Need real field validation on all fields.
* DC etc. not present in footer on all pages except main status page.
* Style/theme need fine-tuning/cleaning (dialog titles, buttons etc. rather
  large, among other things).
* need to cancel running refresh for node details dialog
** actually, need to be able to cancel initial load for any dialog.  crap.
   this is getting kind of messy.
** actually this might be done (*sigh*)
* Clean up error display from all crm* invocations (can be smooshed onto
  one long error line, which is a bit ugly to read).
* remove current_user from cib.rb (it's passed into initialize, is that
  enough removal?)
* use clearTimeout(?) to hose anything set with setTimeout to avoid
  duplicate requests (should never happen, but might if you run e.g.:
  update_cib() from firebug).
* look at memory usage; hawk running under mongrel eventually goes OOM
* Integrate doc/sessions_controller-cleanup.patch, once we verify that
  Shellwords::escape is kosher.
* Dashboard doesn't take url_root into account (either fix this, in which
  case all Hawks need the same url_root [yuck], or just ignore the problem,
  as no default deployment uses url_root anyway)
* Various dialogs (e.g.: editing op attributes) should allow ENTER to trigger
  OK (see keypress handler in hawk/app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb for
  example)
* Options screen with ability to set locale?
  (See: ApplicationController#set_users_locale)
* Consolidate Access-Control-* headers from SessionsController, CibController
  and ApplicationController for CORS requests for dashboard

== UI Controls ==

* ".attrlist-del" to add "Add" and "Edit" headings to ui.attrlist searches
  whole bloody document, so will break if there's more than one attrlist on
  a page.
* mention that ui.oplist, ui.attrlist etc. require escape_html, escape_field


== GUI: Explorer ==

* Enter start time" 2011-11-00" (i.e. bogus); get 500 internal server error
  (range exception), but no feedback in UI
* Button to refresh current view up to "now"
* Cache list might still apepar if you come back to the history page during
  generation (*sigh*)
* Move to tmp directory in hawk, not /tmp?  (May not work if not all nodes
  have Hawk).  Actually this is probably done for everything except hb_report
  generation.
* "Another 'crm history' is running" thing works (node recent events?), but
  there's a flash of both "us" and "them" during update.
* If doing a time period the ends *after* now, need to regenerate each time
  in case something has changed since (could be tricky to detect -- alleviate
  by allowing delete of cached reports)


== GUI: Simulator ==

* Could hide ticket button if funtionality doesn't exist in underlying
  crm_simulate (not just if there's no tickets).
* Auto-fill of interval when injecting ops just grabs the first one (would
  be nice to drop-down with interval and more info about which one it was,
  e.g.: role or OCF_CHECK_LEVEL)
* Purports to run even if server dead (i.e.: Run button results in alleged
  final state being shown), see also bnc#723125.
* Inject a failed start (e.g.: start:0 c2:0 unknown node-0), gives tooltip
  "null failed on node-0 (rc=1)", similar in error bar (operation=).  So the
  name of the failed op isnt' being picked up somehow.  Actually, it's not
  in the CIB (see http://bugs.clusterlabs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5003).  Is this
  still a problem?
* Ability to edit injected ops and node state would be handy
* don't use yellow background (baby's bedroom colour)
* remove injected state button removes all duplicate entries, not just the one
  you selected
* want < > VCR controls
** but really need ability to stack new changes on top of new computed state.


== GUI: Wizard ==

* Add ability for templates to call non-crm commands, e.g.: mkdir on all
  nodes, and deploy custom configuration files, e.g. httpd.conf
  (see bnc#710959)
* ability to have optional steps
* list of steps on LHS?


== GUI: hb_report ==

* Ability to use crm_report instead (or use one or the other, depending on
  what's installed?)
** At least, ensure hb_report is installed before invoking.
* Consider renaming hb_report class to crm_report or similar?
* "Generate hb_report" menu item etc. -- different nomenclature?  Cluster
  Report?  Debug Report?
* HbReport's forked ruby child stalls/never exits if you kill its hb_report
  children.  WTF?
* hb_report: $("#hbreport-status").html doesn't use escape_html...?
* Need to include node name in hb_report (likewise explorer), or
  simultaneous runs from separate nodes will slaughter each other.
* Ability to generate, keep, download multiple hb_reports (not just last one)
** Ability to delete old reports.
* Look at exposing -u and -S options


== GUI: status ==

* Need update to jQuery 1.4.3+ to fix jquery bug #6498 when request timed out
  on IE7.
* Ability to cleanup deleted/orphaned resources.
* Recent events, details.  dialog should say "$node recent events",
  "$node details" etc.
* Can't delete/set target-role of child of clone of group
* Need confirmation on delete resource
* Disable unavailable context menus (no primitives - can't create group)
** (Unless we have group creation go wizard-style to create primitives)
* Ideas:
** Sort by expected time when coming online
** Timeout-based progress bar on resources for pending ops
** Filter textbox to show only resources/nodes of given name/type/etc.
* can use pin icon to indicate migrated
* need some other icon to indicate target role set (tooltip to show target
  role)
* footer breaks over lines if screen too narrow (can live with it for now...)
* likewise error bar
* table view dodgy in IE with big resource names
** view switcher buttons on IE jump up & down (how did we fix that in the
   forms?  some overflow property as well?)
*** position: relative on parent, but can't use this on #content, or it
    screws up the offsets for popup menus
*** (a bit better with IE specific stylesheet, but still some jagging on
    699806.xml)
* confirm_op params don't match perform_op params (what?)
* Panel view, lots of space in the middle.  Could flow better (resources
  in column next to nodes if space allows).
* Summary view, probably want red/broken things expanded by default.
** Requires ability to display both nodes and resources simultaneously
** ...but this would tie-in nicely with a filter textbox
* Vertically align various fields in each resource (name, instance, state,
  node it's on).  It's most obvious this is a problem in the table view.
* #content's overflow: auto seems to be preventing horizontal scrollbar from
  appearing on table view (try 699806.xml)
** actually, the scrollbar appears behind the footer(!)
** and on IE, you get an extra vertical scrollbar too.
*** try "padding-bottom: 2em" on container (done, but it's still fragged in IE)
*** also this pushes the footer always off the bottom of the screen.  bloody hell
*** fixed-ish with overflow: auto on #table (but probably still not perfect)
* For fatal errors on pageload, do we really want to keep the spinner?
** Probably, if the problem might go away...
* Red warning if cluster not quorate and resource startup disabled (e.g.:
  two-node cluster with no-quorum-policy not set to ignore)


== GUI: crm_config Editor ==

* ACL support for crm_config editor lies about successful write
** Actually, it may lie about successful write if some stuff is written but
   some not in the general case.
** crm_attribute can fail silently when deleting attributes.
*** also it can't cope with multiple property sets with same name attrs.
* display expands horribly when window too small (try 800x600 with
  cluster-recheck-interval help)
* Add "advanced" checkbox or similar to hide advanced options by default.
* move save logic from crm_config_controller to crm_config
** See about consolidation with CibObject, resources etc.
* note that we can't show unknown properties in crm_config editor (if they're
  not in all_types we don't want to know, can't check for readonly, etc.)


== GUI: Constraint Editor ==

* See what we can do about making resource templates appear and disappear from
  constraint dropdowns depending on what's actually valid.
** Or not -- it might strictly be best to leave this up to crm_verify etc., and
   just clean up the error messaging.
* https://node-1:7630/cib/live/colocations/fs-then-ctdb/edit picks up an
  *order* constraint (even though it's actually a colocation)
* Need confirmation on delete.
* Should pre-fill ID field (you generally don't care what it is)
** Probably leave it disabled and just fill based on rsc id
* Offer +/-inf scores (combo box)
* Text to describe arrows (will be placed with, will start after)


== GUI: Resource Editor ==

* Primitive editor probably invokes Primitive.types etc. multiple times
  which might be causing hideous slowness (use PerRequestCache)
* Create resource, click "Back" - saw "any changes will be lost"?
* Intervals must have no freaky characters - add regex verify for attrlist?
* op editor shows timeout=20 where there is no timeout specified (still true?)
* need to cope with set_ops having duplicate monitor intervals (e.g.: pcmk
  Stateful defaults)
* op editor may fail badly if unknown instance attributes for ops are
  specified when editing?
* Need to be able to change class:provider:type (e.g.: switch from
  ocf:heartbeat:drbd to ocf:linbit:drbd)
* Can't edit clone/ms child, group members, order of group members
* can't specify arbitrary meta attributes (want combo box)
** e.g.: OCF_CHECK_LEVEL (important)
* can't specify arbitrary params
* Can't specify resource utilization
* Highlight when a setting is different than default
* Highlight what's changed while editing (apply to all editors, crm_config,
  constraints etc.)
* Creating resource when cluster not quorate gives (ugly) "Unable to create
  resource: crm_verify[16586]: 2011/04/14_22:48:47 WARN: cluster_status: We
  do not have quorum - fencing and resource management disabled ..."
* Want ability to go "wizard style" to create clone/group/ms (i.e. create
  clone, then create primitive).
* meta attributes (and maybe op list) don't disable while switching provider,
  type
* Observed previously but unable to reproduce:
** type "delay" to get to delay resource, and it gives you db2 fields,
   then doesn't change them when you get to delay finally
** bash around on type (switch from one to another too quickly for the param
   requests) and you get javascript errors
** create a resource, then (before leaving that page), go edit some other
   resource: "resource created successfully" flash appears on edit page (even
   though obviously nothing new has been created).
* Apply Changes button is disabled when showing error form after edit (but
  we almost never care, unless it was a transient error that really will go
  away just by hitting "Apply" without making any other changes)
* for clone, if there's no suitable children available, the child list will
  be (un-obviously) empty
* defaults for op requires and on-fail need to change per op type, and per
  stonith configuration
* primitive with deleted instance attributes isn't folded back to empty
  element </> (presumably likewise meta_attributes)
** likewise operations
* master is really a copy of clone.  dodgy.
* colspan="4" is wrong for clone and master submit buttons 


== GUI: Template Support ==

(strictly these notes should be merged with resource & constraint editor notes)

* Resources that use templates:
** May not want default ops added
** Don't force required attributes when using template if template specifies
   them already.
** Need to verify that all params are present (juxtapose template with primitive)
** Display template params & ops, so you know what's there
*** Possibly tooltip/help area showing crm shell syntax of template
* Ultimately need to be able to change template type etc. on current primitives
* Need to properly refactor template into/with primitive classes etc.
* class:provider:type won't be passed through in cib hash to javascript properly
  (may not matter - status page shouldn't do anything with it ATM).


== Oddities ==

* Cluster not running, on node-1, IE thinks some content is insecure - wtf?
  (might have been short name vs. FQDN?)
* Some display error oddity in IE on summary view when things
  stop/start/disappear


== May Not Be Broken Anymore (need to verify) ==

* new ms-rule with role=master leaves s0:1 pending on node-0 - wtf?
* delete resources in clones, stale instances hang around (dlm:0 etc.)
* Try stop-all-resources, then start again, filesys:1 shows pending, WTF?
  crm_resource -o includes pending monitor op for some reason
* turn a primitive into a clone, it seems to keep the old state from the
  primitive, e.g.: clone set: c-d3 (d3:0 d3:1 d3:)
* verify what happens if hawk process on the server goes away (does 
  browser refresh work when server comes back)?
** similar question - try hawk on a floating IP, fail it over, what happens?
* have 4 nodes, use `cibadmin --delete --xml-text '<node id="node-2"/>'`
  to delete two of them, note that clusterfs:2 remains stopped (LRM state
  still present for nonexistent node?)
* Resource stop as "bob" (no access) reported as 500, not 403?
* allow render of bare CIB if cluster is not running (works, but may still
  show error)
* FC14: ltdl.h /usr/include/pils/plugin.h:23:20: fatal error: ltdl.h: No
  such file or directory
** in libtool-ltdl-devel
** really should be a require of cluster-glue-libs-devel
