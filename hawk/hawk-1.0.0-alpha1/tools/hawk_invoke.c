/*
 * hawk_invoke allows the hacluster user to run a small assortment of
 * Pacemaker CLI tools as another user, in order to support Pacemaker's
 * ACL feature.
 *
 * hawk_invoke:
 * - must be installed setuid root
 * - will refuse to run if invoked by anyone other than "root" or
 *   "hacluster"
 * - will only setuid() to a non-root user in the "haclient" group.
 * - will in turn only invoke a specific small set of Pacemaker
 *   CLI commands.
 *
 * The idea here is that hawk_invoke:
 * - Will allow "hacluster" or "root" to become a less-privileged
 *   user for the purposes of cluster administration.
 * - Will not allow the "hacluster" user to become a more-privileged
 *   user.
 * - The only exception here is for the execution of hb_report and
 *   "crm history", which must be run as "root", or they won't work.
 * - Will not allow arbitrary commands to be executed as any other
 *   user.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *  /usr/sbin/hawk_invoke <username> <command> [args ...]
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *  username  = name of the user to run command as
 *  command   = short name of command (e.g.: "crm_mon")
 *  args      = any args for command
 *
