= Replicate Storage Using DRBD =

Even if you're serving up static websites, having to manually synchronize
the contents of that website to all the machines in the cluster is not
ideal. For dynamic websites, such as a wiki, it's not even an option. Not
everyone care afford network-attached storage, but somehow the data needs
to be kept in sync.

Enter DRBD, which can be thought of as network-based RAID-1.
footnote:[See http://www.drbd.org/ for details.]

== Install the DRBD Packages ==

DRBD itself is included in the upstream kernel,
footnote:[Since version 2.6.33]
but we do need some utilities to use it effectively. On both nodes, run:

----
# yum install -y drbd-pacemaker drbd-udev
----

== Allocate a Disk Volume for DRBD ==

DRBD will need its own block device on each node. This can be
a physical disk partition or logical volume, of whatever size
you need for your data. For this document, we will use a
1GiB logical volume, which is more than sufficient for a single HTML file and
(later) GFS2 metadata.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# vgdisplay | grep -e Name -e Free
  VG Name               fedora-server_pcmk-1
  Free  PE / Size       511 / 2.00 GiB
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# lvcreate --name drbd-demo --size 1G fedora-server_pcmk-1
Logical volume "drbd-demo" created
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# lvs
  LV        VG                   Attr       LSize Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
  drbd-demo fedora-server_pcmk-1 -wi-a----- 1.00g                                                    
  root      fedora-server_pcmk-1 -wi-ao---- 5.00g                                                    
  swap      fedora-server_pcmk-1 -wi-ao---- 1.00g
----

Repeat this on the second node, making sure to use the same size.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# ssh pcmk-2 -- lvcreate --name drbd-demo --size 1G fedora-server_pcmk-2
Logical volume "drbd-demo" created
----

== Configure DRBD ==

There is no series of commands for building a DRBD configuration, so simply
run this on both nodes to use this sample configuration:

----
# cat <<END >/etc/drbd.d/wwwdata.res
resource wwwdata {
 protocol C;
 meta-disk internal;
 device /dev/drbd1;
 syncer {
  verify-alg sha1;
 }
 net {
  allow-two-primaries;
 }
 on pcmk-1 {
  disk   /dev/fedora-server_pcmk-1/drbd-demo;
  address  192.168.122.101:7789;
 }
 on pcmk-2 {
  disk   /dev/fedora-server_pcmk-2/drbd-demo;
  address  192.168.122.102:7789;
 }
}
END
----

[IMPORTANT]
=========
Edit the file to use the hostnames, IP addresses and logical volume paths
of your nodes if they differ from the ones used in this guide.
=========

[NOTE]
=======
Detailed information on the directives used in this configuration (and
other alternatives) is available at
http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/ch-configure.html

The *allow-two-primaries* option would not normally be used in
an active/passive cluster. We are adding it here for the convenience
of changing to an active/active cluster later.
=======

== Initialize DRBD ==

With the configuration in place, we can now get DRBD running.

These commands create the local metadata for the DRBD resource,
ensure the DRBD kernel module is loaded, and bring up the DRBD resource.
Run them on one node:

----
# drbdadm create-md wwwdata
initializing activity log
NOT initializing bitmap
Writing meta data...
New drbd meta data block successfully created.
# modprobe drbd
# drbdadm up wwwdata
----

We can confirm DRBD's status on this node:

----
# cat /proc/drbd
version: 8.4.5 (api:1/proto:86-101)
srcversion: 153833F4A69E341D3F3E707 

 1: cs:WFConnection ro:Secondary/Unknown ds:Inconsistent/DUnknown C r----s
    ns:0 nr:0 dw:0 dr:0 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:f oos:1048508
----

Because we have not yet initialized the data, this node's data
is marked as *Inconsistent*. Because we have not yet initialized
the second node, the local state is *WFConnection* (waiting for connection),
and the partner node's status is marked as *Unknown*.

Now, repeat the above commands on the second node. This time,
when we check the status, it shows:

----
# cat /proc/drbd
version: 8.4.5 (api:1/proto:86-101)
srcversion: 153833F4A69E341D3F3E707 

 1: cs:Connected ro:Secondary/Secondary ds:Inconsistent/Inconsistent C r-----
    ns:0 nr:0 dw:0 dr:0 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:f oos:1048508
----

You can see the state has changed to *Connected*, meaning the two DRBD nodes
are communicating properly, and both nodes are in *Secondary* role
with *Inconsistent* data.

To make the data consistent, we need to tell DRBD which node should be
considered to have the correct data. In this case, since we are creating
a new resource, both have garbage, so we'll just pick pcmk-1
and run this command on it:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# drbdadm primary --force wwwdata
----

[NOTE]
======
In DRBD 8.3 and earlier, the equivalent command is:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary wwwdata
----
======

If we check the status immediately, we'll see something like this:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# cat /proc/drbd
version: 8.4.5 (api:1/proto:86-101)
srcversion: 153833F4A69E341D3F3E707 

 1: cs:SyncSource ro:Primary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/Inconsistent C r-----
    ns:2872 nr:0 dw:0 dr:3784 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:f oos:1045636
	[>....................] sync'ed:  0.4% (1045636/1048508)K
	finish: 0:10:53 speed: 1,436 (1,436) K/sec
----

We can see that this node has the *Primary* role, the partner node has
the *Secondary* role, this node's data is now considered *UpToDate*,
the partner node's data is still *Inconsistent*, and a progress bar
shows how far along the partner node is in synchronizing the data.

After a while, the sync should finish, and you'll see something like:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# cat /proc/drbd
version: 8.4.5 (api:1/proto:86-101)
srcversion: 153833F4A69E341D3F3E707 

 1: cs:Connected ro:Primary/Secondary ds:UpToDate/UpToDate C r-----
    ns:1048508 nr:0 dw:0 dr:1049420 al:0 bm:0 lo:0 pe:0 ua:0 ap:0 ep:1 wo:f oos:0
----

Both sets of data are now *UpToDate*, and we can proceed to creating
and populating a filesystem for our WebSite resource's documents.

== Populate the DRBD Disk ==

On the node with the primary role (pcmk-1 in this example),
create a filesystem on the DRBD device:

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# mkfs.ext4 /dev/drbd1
mke2fs 1.42.11 (09-Jul-2014)
Creating filesystem with 262127 4k blocks and 65536 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 26879260-9077-4d6d-ad69-7d31d3d8d8d4
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (4096 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example, we create an ext4 filesystem with no special options.
In a production environment, you should choose a filesystem type and
options that are suitable for your application.
====

Mount the newly created filesystem, populate it with our web document,
then unmount it (the cluster will handle mounting and unmounting it later):

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# mount /dev/drbd1 /mnt
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# cat <<-END >/mnt/index.html
 <html>
  <body>My Test Site - DRBD</body>
 </html>
END
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# umount /dev/drbd1
----

== Configure the Cluster for the DRBD device ==

One handy feature `pcs` has is the ability to queue up several changes
into a file and commit those changes atomically.  To do this, start by
populating the file with the current raw XML config from the CIB.

----
# pcs cluster cib drbd_cfg
----

Using the `pcs -f` option, make changes to the configuration saved
in the +drbd_cfg+ file. These changes will not be seen by the cluster until
the +drbd_cfg+ file is pushed into the live cluster's CIB later.

Here, we create a cluster resource for the DRBD device, and an additional _clone_
resource to allow the resource to run on both nodes at the same time.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f drbd_cfg resource create WebData ocf:linbit:drbd \
         drbd_resource=wwwdata op monitor interval=60s
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f drbd_cfg resource master WebDataClone WebData \
         master-max=1 master-node-max=1 clone-max=2 clone-node-max=1 \
         notify=true
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f drbd_cfg resource show
 ClusterIP	(ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):	Started 
 WebSite	(ocf::heartbeat:apache):	Started 
 Master/Slave Set: WebDataClone [WebData]
     Stopped: [ pcmk-1 pcmk-2 ]
----

After you are satisfied with all the changes, you can commit
them all at once by pushing the drbd_cfg file into the live CIB.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs cluster cib-push drbd_cfg 
CIB updated
----

[NOTE]
====
Early versions of `pcs` required `push cib` in place of `cib-push` above.
====

Let's see what the cluster did with the new configuration:
----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs status

PCSD Status:

  pcmk-2: Online

Daemon Status:

----

We can see that *WebDataClone* (our DRBD device) is running as master (DRBD's
primary role) on *pcmk-1* and slave (DRBD's secondary role) on *pcmk-2*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The resource agent should load the DRBD module when needed if it's not already
loaded. If that does not happen, configure your operating system to load the
module at boot time. For Fedora 21, you would run this on both nodes:
----
# echo drbd >/etc/modules-load.d/drbd.conf
----
====

== Configure the Cluster for the Filesystem ==

Now that we have a working DRBD device, we need to mount its filesystem.

In addition to defining the filesystem, we also need to
tell the cluster where it can be located (only on the DRBD Primary)
and when it is allowed to start (after the Primary was promoted).

We are going to take a shortcut when creating the resource this time.
Instead of explicitly saying we want the *ocf:heartbeat:Filesystem* script, we
are only going to ask for *Filesystem*. We can do this because we know there is only
one resource script named *Filesystem* available to pacemaker, and that pcs is smart
enough to fill in the *ocf:heartbeat:* portion for us correctly in the configuration.
If there were multiple *Filesystem* scripts from different OCF providers, we would need
to specify the exact one we wanted.

Once again, we will queue our changes to a file and then push the
new configuration to the cluster as the final step.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs cluster cib fs_cfg
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg resource create WebFS Filesystem \
         device="/dev/drbd1" directory="/var/www/html" \

[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg constraint order promote WebDataClone then start WebFS
Adding WebDataClone WebFS (kind: Mandatory) (Options: first-action=promote then-action=start)
----

We also need to tell the cluster that Apache needs to run on the same
machine as the filesystem and that it must be active before Apache can
start.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg constraint colocation add WebSite with WebFS INFINITY
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs -f fs_cfg constraint order WebFS then WebSite

== Test Cluster Failover ==

Previously, we used `pcs cluster stop pcmk-1` to stop all cluster
services on *pcmk-1*, failing over the cluster resources, but there is another
way to safely simulate node failure.

We can put the node into _standby mode_. Nodes in this state continue to
run corosync and pacemaker but are not allowed to run resources. Any resources
found active there will be moved elsewhere. This feature can be particularly
useful when performing system administration tasks such as updating packages
used by cluster resources.

Put the active node into standby mode, and observe the cluster move all
the resources to the other node. The node's status will
change to indicate that it can no longer host resources.

we just wanted to see the resources move), we can allow the node to be a
full cluster member again.

stay where they are due to our resource stickiness settings configured earlier.
